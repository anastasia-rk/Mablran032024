   abstract = {Aims: To provide data on the effects on culture temperature and physiological state of cells on heat resistance of Enterococcus faecium, which may be useful in establishing pasteurization procedures. Methods and Results: The heat resistance of this Ent. faecium (ATCC 49624 strain) grown at different temperatures was monitored at various stages of growth. In all cases, the bacterial cells in the logarithmic phase of growth were more heat sensitive. For cells which had entered in the stationary phase, D70 values of 0.53 min at 5°C, 0.74 min at 10°C, 0.83 min at 20°C, 0.79 min at 30°C, 0.63 min at 37°C, 0.48 min at 40°C and 0.41 min at 45°C were found. By extending the incubation times cells were more heat resistant as stationary phase progressed, although a different pattern was observed for cells grown at different temperatures. At the lower temperatures heat resistance increased progressively, reaching D70 values of 1.73 min for cells incubated at 5°C for 50 days and 1.04 min for those grown at 10°C for 16 days. At other temperatures assayed heat resistance became stable for late stationary phase cells, reaching D70 values of 1.05, 1.08 and 1.01 min for cultures incubated at 20, 30 and 37°C. Heat resistance of cells obtained at higher temperatures, 40 and 45°C, was significantly lower, with D70 values of 0.76 and 0.67 min, respectively. Neither the growth temperature nor the growth phase modified the z-values significantly. Conclusions: D70 values obtained for Ent. faecium (ATCC 49624) varies from 0.33 to 1.73 min as a function of culture temperature and physiological state of cells. However, z values calculated were not significantly influenced by these factors. A mean value of 4.50 ± 0.39¶C was found. Significance and Impact of the Study: Overall results strongly suggest that, to establish heat processing conditions of pasteurized foods ensuring elimination of Ent. faecium, it is advisable to take into account the complex interaction of growth temperature and growth phase of cells acting on bacterial thermal resistance.},

   abstract = {Influence of pH and temperature on the growth of Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis. Abstract-A total of 70 enterococcal strains isolated from traditional Italian raw milk cheeses were identified by API 20 Strep and Biolog GP. All the identifications were confirmed by species-specific PCR. Four species of genus Enterococcus were found: E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. durans and E. hirae. E. faecalis and E. faecium were the dominant enterococcal species isolated in artisanal cheeses. According to the most representative species and the origin of isolation, 21 strains (11 E. fae-calis and 10 E. faecium) were selected for the conductimetric analysis. The influence of pH (5.0; 5.5; 6.0 and 6.5) and temperature (25 °C and 37 °C) on the metabolism and the development of ente-rococci was evaluated by determination of Generation Time (GT), Detection Time (DT) and the maximum conductance value (∆µS) of the curve during a period of 48 hours. Conductance trials showed that both species were able to adapt to adverse cultural conditions (low values of pH and temperature) during cheese-making and ripening. E. faecalis appeared to be less sensitive on the whole. In the worst conditions (pH 5.0, 25 °C), after an adaptation phase (about 10 h), these microorganisms showed GT values almost double those at 37 °C. The same behavior can occur in cheese, where enterococci can reach numbers of up to 10 5-10 8 cfu·g-1 during ripening. This could explain the fact that enterococci (in particular, E. faecalis and E. faecium) represent the typical and important microflora in raw milk cheese.

However, these bacteria can cause severe infections in susceptible individuals. The strains of Enterococcus faecium have demonstrated an increasing resistance to antibiotics, which is considered an important virulence factor. The contribution of E. faecium to the infection-related illnesses has recently increased, which involves most of the isolated Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus (VRE) strains. Enterococci are common contaminants of human milk processed in milk banks, and the consumption of contaminated milk can cause severe infection-related complications if the control mechanisms fail to detect the contamination. Extensive data are available on the growth curves of E. faecium in broth at pH values between 6 and 7, at temperatures of 5°C to 20°C, and for water activity values a w of 0.97 to 0.997. These growth curves were replaced with non-linear Gompertz curves for microorganism growth, the parameters of which were correlated with the temperature and pH values. A mathematical relationship to water activity could not be established since only two water activity levels have been experimentally tested and the resulting model would be highly inaccurate. The issue of water activity was resolved by the development of two separate models, one for each of the water activity values. The models correspond very well with the experimental growth curve data from which they were developed. The model for the water activity level of 0.997 was used to predict the growth of E. faecium in cow and human milks (these two fluids have practically identical water activity), and the prediction was compared to the experimental data. A good agreement between the predicted and experimental data was achieved for cow milk. With human milk, the model usually predicted a more rapid growth rate than that seen experimentally. The model was thus on the conservative side in all cases. The inhibitory agents naturally present in human milk might be responsible for the slower growth rates.},

   abstract = {A method was developed to combine qualitative and quantitative information to predict possible growth of microorganisms in foods. The pH, water activity, temperature, and oxygen availability of foods are coupled to the growth characteristics of microorganisms. Therefore, a database with characteristics of foods and a database of kinetic parameters of microorganisms were built. In the first database, a tree structure based on physical similarity was built, for the case that information about the characteristics of a particular food is unknown. By comparing with similar products at the same level of the tree or the level above, the product information can be estimated. A method is developed to make an estimation of the microbial growth kinetics on the basis of models. This is done by introducing a growth factor, which can be calculated on the basis of readily available data from literature. Since all the information can be altered, the system can give better predictions when more and more accurate information is added. Food quality Food quality can be defined as the sum of the characteristics of a food that determines the satisfaction of the consumer and compliance to legal standards. Thus, food quality is a combination of numerous factors, such as organoleptic properties (e.g., texture, flavor, color), nutritional value (e.g., caloric content, fatty acid composition), and safety conditions (e.g., microbial number, toxins, hormones). Some of these factors (e.g., microbial numbers) can be quantified relatively easily, others (e.g., flavor) are very difficult to assess quantitatively. Food quality thus cannot be quantified in every detail, and overall quantifica-tion depends strongly on the priority of the different aspects determining the quality. To determine the total food quality , quality indicators are needed and must be weighted, depending on the product, trends, producer, and market. Food quality is gaining more and more interest for a number of reasons. The food market deals in most cases with satiation; therefore, quality becomes more important than quantity. There are new quality attributes which are highly appreciated by the modern consumer (in contrast to traditional quality demands). Consumers show an increasing interest in convenience foods with the appearance and taste of fresh products and food quality aspects such as flavor and (assumed) health aspects (e.g., nutrition, fatty acid quantity and composition, energy content, salt concentration , additives, such as preservatives). Prediction of the kinetics of possible quality loss is important for the following reasons. Consumers are willing to pay a higher price for quality. The manufacturer wants to produce constant quality products at the lowest costs. Many products have a limited shelf life. Production and storage conditions affect quality very strongly; therefore, production and distribution are often critical. From the past there are many dried, salted, frozen, sterilized products, while nowadays chilled and intermediate-moisture foods are becoming more important. The shelf life of a product should match the distribution regime: daily delivery for perishable products such as fresh milk, bread, fresh vegetables , and fresh meat, or less frequently as for salads, margarine, etc. Distribution routes have become longer, and therefore, there is a need for an increase in shelf life. In some areas there is a rather rapid product development (changes in product formulation). Consequently, it will be very useful to make an estimation of the shelf life during product development. Formulation of products may be different in different countries or regions, because of legal requirements or regional food preferences. Therefore, it would be useful to know the effects of different compositions on the shelf life, so that each formulation does not require a laborious shelf-life test. New techniques are being developed to meet these quality demands, such as new technologies (e.g., microwave , ultrahigh temperature processes, modified atmosphere packaging, irradiation), and new strategies (e.g., logistics, and modeling). Quality loss Quality loss can be a result of microbial, chemical, enzymatic, or physical reactions. Different factors influence quality loss, such as the composition of the product, and the processing and storage conditions. Deterioration reactions may occur when the physical variables of the product are within the range of the specific reaction. For quantification of the reaction rate, the kinetics of the reaction should be known. This can be done by models that include the range in which spoilage can occur and the physical variables of the product. As soon as good models are available and},

This idea was extended further in this work by including the effects of the lag and stationary growth phases on microbial growth rate as independent gamma factors. A mechanistic description of the stationary phase as a function of pH was included, based on a novel class of models that consider product inhibition. Experimental results on Escherichia coli growth dynamics indicated that also the parameters of the product inhibition equations can be modelled with the gamma approach.

The first class of mutants (K-I) cannot grow below 20 C in either complex or minimal medium, but grows at nearly normal rates at 37 C on both types of media. Normal growth rate at 20 C can be conferred on these mutants by infection at a low multiplicity with a transducing phage grown on the parent. The second class of mutants (K-II) fails to grow only in minimal medium at 20 C. These mutants are characterized by their singular response to specific nutrients in minimal medium at 20 C. The third class of mutants (K-Ill) grows normally in minimal medium at all temperatures with either glucose or glycerol as the carbon source, but does not grow at 20 C with lactose as the carbon source. Numerous studies have been devoted to investigation of the maximal temperature of growth of microorganisms. Mutations have been reported which result in a decrease of the maximal temperature of growth (Ingraham, 1962). In most of the cases reported, the production of a heat-labile protein accounts for the inability to grow at elevated temperatures. Edgar and Lielausis (1963), however, found mutants of phage which were unable to produce certain proteins at high temperatures. Conversely, mutations which affect the minimal temperature of growth of microorganisms have not been extensively studied. Allen (1953) reported that stenothermophilic aerobic spore-formers frequently undergo spontaneous mutation to eurithermophily, and Azuma, Newton, and Witter (1962) reported a mutation in Pseu-domonas aeruginosa which decreased the minimal temperature of growth. Maas (1961) described a mutant of Escherichia coli which synthesized or-nithine transcarbamylase at 37 but not at 25 C. In this paper, we describe the isolation and properties of mutants of E. coli with increased minimal temperatures of growth.},

The original formulation of Sharpe and DeMichele is poorly suited for non-linear regression. Very high correlations of parameter estimators occassionally make regression with their equation impossible using Marquardt's algorithm (1963). This analysis describes a new formulation of Sharpe and DeMichele's model that greatly alleviates the non-linear regression problem. It is partly based on Hultin's formulation (1955). Biological and graphical interpretation of the model parameters is discussed. Regression suitability is illustrated with a typical data set. Similar modifications to the equations of Hultin (1955) and Johnson & Lewin (1946) are described. © 1981.},

   abstract = {A comparison was made between mathematical variations of the square root and Schoolfield models for predicting growth rate as a function of temperature. The statistical consequences of square root and natural logarithm transformations of growth rate used in several variations of the Schoolfield and square root models were examined. Growth rate variances of Yersinia enterocolitica in brain heart infusion broth increased as a function of temperature. The ability of the two data transformations to correct for the heterogeneity ofvariance was evaluated. A natural logarithm transformation of growth rate was more effective than a square root transformation at correcting for the heterogeneity of variance. The square root model was more accurate than the Schoolfield model when both models used natural logarithm transformation. The square root and Schoolfield models are frequently compared for their ability to predict bacterial growth rate or lag time as a function of temperature. Several variations which involve the transformation of growth rate or lag time to either a square root or logarithmic scale have been developed for both models. The original formulation of the square root model utilizes a square root transformation. A logarithm transformation is frequently used with the Schoolfield model (7). The statistical appropriateness of these two transformations of growth rate and the consequences of weighted regression were investigated. Square root model variates. The square root model, proposed by Ratkwosky et al. (6), is given as: Vlk = b(T-Tmn) \{1-exp[c(T-Tmax)]\} (1) where k is the growth rate (time-'), b is a regression coefficient , T is the temperature (K), Tmm is the notional minimum growth temperature (K), c is a regression coefficient, and Tm. is the notional maximum growth temperature (K). In equation 1, extrapolations above Tm. result in positive growth rate predictions. A modification of the model which eliminates this effect was proposed by Zwietering et al. (11). The three square root model variates investigated in this study are based on this modified model. The model variate as proposed by Zwietering et al. is: k = [b(T-Tmn)12\{1-exp[c(T-Tma)]\} (2) A square root transformation of equation 2 gives: V/k = b(T-Tmi) \{1-exp[c(T-Tma,)\} (3) A natural logarithm transformation of equation 2 gives: ln(k) = ln([b(T-Tm.)]2\{1-exp[c(T-Tma)]\}) (4) Schoolfield model variates. The Schoolfield model is derived from Arrhenius rate kinetics. The model was originally proposed by Sharpe and DeMichele (9).},

This study aims to evaluate the influence of biochar addition on bacterial community and physicochemical properties changes, including ammonium (NH4+), nitrite (NO2−) and nitrate (NO3−) contents during the composting of poultry manure. The composting was carried out by adding 20% (w/w) of biochar into the mixture of poultry manure and rice straw with a ratio of 2:1, and the same treatment without biochar was prepared as a control. The finished product of control compost recorded the high contents of NO2− and NO3− (366 mg/kg and 600 mg/kg) with reduced the total NH4+ content to 10 mg/kg. Meanwhile, biochar compost recorded a higher amount of total NH4+ content (110 mg/kg) with low NO2− and NO3− (161 mg/kg and 137 mg/kg) content in the final composting material. The principal component analysis showed that the dynamics of dominant genera related to Halomonas, Pusillimonas, and Pseudofulvimonas, all of which were known as nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria, was significantly correlated with the dynamic of NO2− and NO3− content throughout the composting process. The genera related to Pusillimonas, and Pseudofulvimonas appeared as the dominant communities as the NO2− and NO3− increased. In contrast, as the NO2− and NO3− concentration decreased, the Halomonas genus were notably enriched in biochar compost. This study revealed the bacterial community shifts corresponded with the change of physicochemical properties, which provides essential information for a better understanding of monitoring and improving the composting process.},

The development of Arrhenius‐type (‘Schoolfield’) and Bêlehrádek‐type (square root) models that describe microbial growth rates is briefly described. Both types of model have been advocated for use in predictive microbiology. On the basis of published data sets for the growth of bacteria, the consequences of mathematical transformation of data and the use of invalid stochastic assumptions upon model predictions are demonstrated. Mean square error is shown to be an inappropriate criterion by which to compare the performance of predictive models. The data show that bacterial growth responses such as generation time and lag time become more variable as their mean magnitude increases. The practical consequences of such variability for predictive microbiology are discussed. Copyright © 1991, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

For inactivation rates obtained both at isothermic condition, a constant temperature of 58°C, with a seven level pH range (pH 3 to pH 9), and a three level range of values of a(w) (0.928 to 0.995); and anisothermic conditions (a range of inactivation temperature 52.05 to 63.10°C, with a four level pH range of between pH 3 to pH 9, and a three level range of a(w) from 0.928 to 0.995), the model gave a very high degree of fit. The synthesised model is quadratic in form. For isothermic inactivation the model has three terms (pH, pH2, and a(w)2) and explained 96.7% of the variance accounted for (% V) in the overall data (i.e. seven levels of pH and three levels of a(w)). The model with four terms (l/T, pH, pH2, and a(w)2) explained 80.7 % V in the overall anisothermic data, and between 90.1 and 95.3 % V at each level of a(w). Comparison with an existing model highlighted the advantages of the newly synthesised model including ease of formulation, and ease of use. The new model form should permit ready integration with equations describing the viscous and thermal properties in design for batch or continuous steriliser design. Findings suggest an additive linear-Arrhenius model is applicable to the combined influence of n environmental factors on the thermal inactivation rate.},

   abstract = {Litter moisture contents vary greatly between and within practical poultry barns. The current experiment was designed to measure the effects of 8 different dietary characteristics on litter and excreta moisture content. Additionally, free water content and water activity of the excreta and litter were evaluated as additional quality measures. The dietary treatments consisted of nonstarch polysaccharide content (NSP; corn vs. wheat), particle size of insoluble fiber (coarse vs. finely ground oat hulls), viscosity of a nonfermentable fiber (low- and high-viscosity carboxymethyl cellulose), inclusion of a clay mineral (sepiolite), and inclusion of a laxative electrolyte (MgSO4). The 8 treatments were randomly assigned to cages within blocks, resulting in 12 replicates per treatment with 6 birds per replicate. Limited effects of the dietary treatments were noted on excreta and litter water activity, and indications were observed that this measurement is limited in highmoisture samples. Increasing dietary NSP content by feeding a corn-based diet (low NSP) compared with a wheat-based diet (high NSP) increased water intake, excreta moisture and free water, and litter moisture content. Adding insoluble fibers to the wheat-based diet reduced excreta and litter moisture content, as well as litter water activity. Fine grinding of the oat hulls diminished the effect on litter moisture and water activity. However, excreta moisture and free water content were similar when fed finely or coarsely ground oat hulls. The effects of changing viscosity and adding a clay mineral or laxative deviated from results observed in previous studies. Findings of the current experiment indicate a potential for excreta free water measurement as an additional parameter to assess excreta quality besides total moisture. The exact implication of this parameter warrants further investigation. © 2014 Poultry Science Association Inc.},

The waste material needs to be carefully managed to reduce food safety risks and to provide conditions that are comfortable and safe for the birds. Water activity (Aw) is an important thermodynamic property that has been shown to be more closely related to microbial, chemical and physical properties of natural products than moisture content. In poultry litter, Aw is relevant for understanding microbial activity; litter handling and rheological properties; and relationships between in-shed relative humidity and litter moisture content. We measured the Aw of poultry litter collected throughout a meat chicken grow-out (from fresh pine shavings bedding material to day 52) and over a range of litter moisture content (10-60%). The Aw increased non-linearly from 0.71 to 1.0, and reached a value of 0.95 when litter moisture content was only 22-33%. Accumulation of manure during the grow-out reduced Aw for the same moisture content. These results are relevant for making decisions regarding litter re-use in multiple grow-outs as well as setting targets for litter moisture content to minimise odour, microbial risks and to ensure necessary litter physical conditions are maintained during a grow-out. Methods to predict Aw in poultry litter from moisture content are proposed.},

   abstract = {Aims: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of moisture on thermal inactivation of Salmonella spp. in poultry litter under optimal composting conditions. Methods and Results: Thermal inactivation of Salmonella was studied in fresh poultry compost by simulating early phase of composting process. A mixture of three Salmonella serotypes grown in Tryptic soy broth with rifampin (TSB-R) was inoculated in fresh compost with 40 or 50% moisture at a final concentration of c. 7logCFUg -1. The inoculated compost was kept in an environmental chamber which was programmed to rise from room temperature to target composting temperatures in 2days. In poultry compost with optimal moisture content (50%), Salmonella spp. survived for 96, 72 and 24h at 50, 55 and 60°C, respectively, as compared with 264, 144 and 72h at 50, 55 and 60°C, respectively, in compost with suboptimal moisture (40%). Pathogen decline was faster during the come-up time owing to higher ammonia volatilization. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that Salmonella spp. survived longer in fresh poultry compost with suboptimal moisture of 40% than in compost with optimal moisture of 50% during thermophilic composting. High nitrogen content of the poultry compost is an additional factor contributing to Salmonella inactivation through ammonia volatilization during thermal exposure. Significance and Impact of the Study: This research validated the effectiveness of the current composting guidelines on Salmonella inactivation in fresh poultry compost. Both initial moisture level and ammonia volatilization are important factors affecting microbiological safety and quality of compost product. © 2012 The Authors.

Experiments in TSB with 0% gelatin were carried out in shaken erlenmeyers, in the weak 1% gelatin media in petri plates and in the firm 5% gelatin media in gel cassettes. A quantification of gel strength was performed by rheological measurements and the influence of oxygen supply on the growth of S.

Both in broth and in gelatinized media, lowering pH or water activity caused a decrease of growth rate. In media with 1% gelatin a reduction of growth rate and maximal cell density was observed compared to broth at all conditions. However, the effects of decreasing pH and aw were less pronounced. A further increase in gelatin concentration to 5% gelatin caused a small or no additional drop of growth rate. The final oxygen concentration dropped from 5.5 ppm in stirred broth to anoxic values in petri plates, also when 0% and 5% gelatin media were tested in this recipient. Probably, not stirring the medium, which leads to anoxic conditions, has a more pronounced effect on the growth rate of S. Typhimurium then medium solidness. Finally, growth data were fitted with the primary model of Baranyi and Roberts [Baranyi, J. and Roberts, T. A., 1994. A dynamic approach to predicting bacterial growth in food. International Journal of Food Microbiology 23, 277-294]. An additional factor was introduced into the secondary model of Ross et al. [Ross, T. and Ratkowsky, D. A. and Mellefont, L. A. and McMeekin, T. A., 2003. Modelling the effects of temperature, water activity, pH and lactic acid concentration on the growth rate of Escherichia coli. International Journal of Food Microbiology 82, 33-43.] to incorporate the effect of gelatin concentration, next to the effect of pH and aw. A two step and a global regression procedure were applied. Both procedures were able to fit the data well, but the global regression procedure led to smaller standard errors on the parameters. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this study was to quantify the lag time of re-growth of heated spores of Bacillus cereus as a function of the conditions of the heat treatment: temperature, duration and pH of the recovery medium. For a given heating temperature, curves plotting lag times versus time of heating show more or less complex patterns. However, under a heating time corresponding to a decrease of 2 decimal logarithms of the surviving populations of spores, a linear relationship between the lag time of growth and the time of the previous heat treatment can be observed. The slope of this linear relationship followed itself a Bigelow type linear relationship, the slope of which yielded a ζ-value very close to the observed conventional z-value. It was then concluded that the slope of the regrowth lag time versus the heating time followed a linear relationship with the sterilisation value reached in the course of the previous heat treatment. A sharp effect of the pH of the medium which could be described by a simple "secondary" model was observed. As expected, the observed intercept of the linear relationship between lag time and heating time (lag without previous heating) was dependent on only the pH of the medium and not on the heating temperature. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Aims: To mathematically model published thermal inactivation data sets using an empirical model based on a double Arrhenius function. Methods and Results: A mathematical model, the log R-fat, provided an excellent description of the data sets available: the thermal inactivation of Salmonella anatum at 55°C, Pseudomonas viscosa at 48°C and Streptococcus faecalis at 60°C; Clostridium botulinum spores at various temperatures in the range of 101-121°C (two data sets); thermal inactivation of Salmonella Bedford over the temperature range 50-58°C, water activity range of 0.94-0.99 and a pH range of 4-7; Bacillus stearothermophilus spores from 105 to 121°C and the dry heat sterilization of an indigenous mesophilic soil population over the temperature range of 120-160°C. Conclusions: The log R-fat model, derived from previously published chemical inactivation studies provides as good, if not better, description of thermal inactivation kinetics as other published models. The model does not invoke either of the two hypotheses of inactivation: the mechanistic or vitalistic, although it is closely linked to descriptions of the former. Significance and Impact of the study: The log R-fat double Arrhenius function provides the investigator with a relatively simple and easy mathematical model to apply to data of thermal inactivation. This model may allow a more accurate description of thermal food processing, especially when the safety of marginal heat processes are concerned.},

   abstract = {Chicken litter (a mixture of chicken manure, wood shavings, waste feed, and feathers) was composted in forced-aeration piles to understand the changes and losses of nitrogen (N) during composting. During the composting process, the chemical [different N fractions, organic matter (OM), organic carbon (C), and C:N ratio], physical, and microbial properties of the chicken litter were examined. Cumulative losses and mass balances of N and organic matter were also quantified to determine actual losses during composting. The changes in total N concentration of the chicken litter piles were essentially equal to those of the organic N. The inorganic N concentrations were low, and that organic N was the major nitrogenous constituent. The ammonium (NH4+)-N concentration decreased dramatically during first 35 days of composting. However, the rapid decrease in NH4+-N during composting did not coincide with a rapid increase in (NO3-+NO2-)-N concentration. The concentration of (NO3-+NO2-)-N was very low (<0.5 g kg-1) at day 0, and this level remained unchanged during the first 35 days of composting suggesting that N was lost during composting. Losses of N in this composting process were governed mainly by volatilization of ammonia (NH3) as the pile temperatures were high and the pH values were above 7. The narrow C:N ratio (<20:1) have also contributed to losses of N in the chicken litter. The OM and total organic C mass decreased with composting time. About 42 kg of the organic C was converted to CO2. On the other hand, 18 kg was lost during composting. This loss was more than half (59%) of the initial N mass of the piles. Such a finding demonstrates that composting reduced the value of the chicken litter as N fertilizer. However, the composted chicken contained a more humified (stabilized) OM compared with the uncomposted chicken litter, which would enhance its value as a soil conditioner.

Therefore, we examined their reciprocal effects by analyzing the intestinal microbiotas of broilers reared on fresh pine shavings versus reused litter, as well as the litter microbiota over a 6-week cycle. Composite ileal mucosal and cecal luminal samples from birds (n 10) reared with both litter conditions (fresh versus reused) were collected at 7, 14, 21, and 42 days of age. Litter samples were also collected at days 7, 14, 21, and 42. The microbiotas were profiled and compared within sample types based on litter condition using PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). The microbiotas were further analyzed using 16S rRNA gene clone libraries constructed from microbiota DNA extracted from both chick intestinal and litter samples collected at day 7. Results showed significant reciprocal effects between the microbiotas present in the litter and those in the intestines of broilers. Fresh litter had more environmental bacteria, while reused litter contained more bacteria of intestinal origin. Lactobacillus spp. dominated the ileal mucosal microbiota of fresh-litter chicks, while a group of bacteria yet to be classified within Clostridiales dominated in the ileal mucosal microbiota in the reused-litter chicks. The Litter condition (fresh versus reused) seemed to have a more profound impact on the ileal microbiota than on the cecal microbiota. The data suggest that the influence of fresh litter on ileal microbiota decreased as broilers grew, compared with temporal changes observed under reused-litter rearing conditions.},

This was done by evaluating the litter before and after composting for the abundance of ten gene targets associated with antibiotic resistance or horizontal gene transfer, the composition of the bacterial communities, and the abundance of viable enteric bacteria. The abundance of gene targets was determined by qPCR and the microbial community composition of chicken litter determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Enteric bacteria were enumerated by viable plate count. A majority of the gene targets were more abundant in conventional than in RWA litter. In both litter types, the absolute abundance of all of the target genes decreased after composting except sul1, intI1, incW and erm(F) that remained stable. Composting significantly reduced the abundance of enteric bacteria, including those carrying antibiotic resistance. The major difference in bacterial community composition between conventional and RWA litter was due to members affiliated to the genus Pseudomonas, which were 28% more abundant in conventional than in RWA litter. Composting favoured the presence of thermophilic bacteria, such as those affiliated with the genus Truepera, but decreased the abundance of those bacterial genera associated with cold-adapted species, such as Carnobacterium, Psychrobacter and Oceanisphaera. The present study shows that chicken litter from broilers fed with a diet supplemented with antibiotic has an increased abundance of some ARGs, even after composting. However, we can conclude that fertilization with composted litter represents a reduced risk of transmission of antibiotic resistance genes and enteric bacteria of poultry origin to soil and crops than will fertilization with raw litter.},

Functions derived from the model can describe the known shapes of survival curves (concave, convex, sigmoid, linear, on semi-log plot), the tailing-off phenomenon, some prominent behaviour of growing population kinetics, and are provided with fair predictive power. The main features of the model as heat inactivation is concerned are: (1) always the survival curves are expected to be concave on semi-log plot, unless some lag occurs in reaching the treatment temperature; (2) the tailing-off occurs when the concentration of living cells and/or water molecules having lethal energy is low enough; (3) heat inactivation curve at any temperature and whichever is the water content of the medium can easily be predicted, provided a single survivor concentration after time t at temperature T in a medium of defined composition is known; (4) the energy value of molecules leading to inactivation is about half the activation energy expected from classical thermodynamic treatment of reaction rate; (5) the concentration of water molecules having enough energy to drive the process changes exactly Q10 times each 10 °C or ten times each z degrees. As radiation or chemical inactivation is concerned the model allows the description of known shapes of survival curves, linking the shape of the survival curve to the concentration of specific cellular molecular groups. Appropriate modification of the fundamental equation of the model leads to description of cell growth kinetics as a function of cell concentration, temperature, water content in the environment, the presence of metabolic by-products, antimetabolites, etc., as well as to the formulation of hypotheses about growth, death and senescence regulating structures. © 1981.},

A linear relationship was obtained on the Arrhenius plot for the death of cells heated with each antimicrobial agent. The kinetics of the action of the surfactant, however, differed from that of sorbic acid. With the amphoteric surfactant, the activation enthalpy of the death reaction decreased from 108 to 51 kcal/mol as the concentration of surfactant was increased in the range tested although the death rate remained high; whereas with sorbic acid the activation enthalpy remained fairly constant (104 ± 9 kcal/mol) independent of its concentration and the death rate was similarly high. Further, in the action of the amphoteric surfactant, a thermodynamic compensation effect was observed, the compensation temperature being 334°K (61°C), i.e., relatively close to the observed temperatures. For sorbic acid, however, this temperature seemed to be too high to observe when determined from the Arrhenius plot. The data of the dependency of the death‐rate constant upon the concentration of antimicrobial agent indicated a similar difference in the action of the two agents. Based on our results and on data obtained by other workers, we propose that antimicrobial agents that enhance cellular death induced by heating can be characterized into two types.

For inactivation rates obtained both at isothermic condition, a constant temperature of 58°C, with a seven level pH range (pH 3 to pH 9), and a three level range of values of a(w) (0.928 to 0.995); and anisothermic conditions (a range of inactivation temperature 52.05 to 63.10°C, with a four level pH range of between pH 3 to pH 9, and a three level range of a(w) from 0.928 to 0.995), the model gave a very high degree of fit. The synthesised model is quadratic in form. For isothermic inactivation the model has three terms (pH, pH2, and a(w)2) and explained 96.7% of the variance accounted for (% V) in the overall data (i.e. seven levels of pH and three levels of a(w)). The model with four terms (l/T, pH, pH2, and a(w)2) explained 80.7 % V in the overall anisothermic data, and between 90.1 and 95.3 % V at each level of a(w). Comparison with an existing model highlighted the advantages of the newly synthesised model including ease of formulation, and ease of use. The new model form should permit ready integration with equations describing the viscous and thermal properties in design for batch or continuous steriliser design. Findings suggest an additive linear-Arrhenius model is applicable to the combined influence of n environmental factors on the thermal inactivation rate.},

   abstract = {The increase in temperature in compost piles/landfill sites due to micro-organisms undergoing exothermic reactions is modelled. A simplified model is considered in which only biological self-heating is present. The heat release rate due to biological activity is modelled by a function which is a monotonic increasing function of temperature over the range 0 ≤ T ≤ a, whilst for T ≥ a it is a monotone decreasing function of temperature. This functional dependence represents the fact that micro-organisms die or become dormant at high temperatures. The bifurcation behaviour is investigated for 1-d slab and 2-d rectangular slab geometries. In both cases there are two generic steady-state diagrams including one in which the temperature-response curve is the standard S-shaped curve familiar from combustion problems. Thus biological self-heating can cause elevated temperature raises due to jumps in the steady temperature. This problem is used to test a recently developed semi-analytical technique. For the 2-d problem a four-term expansion is found to give highly accurate results-the error of the semi-analytical solution is much smaller than the error due to uncertainty in parameter values. We conclude that the semi-analytical technique is a very promising method for the investigation of bifurcations in spatially distributed systems. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
